Frontend Assessment - Project 2
===============================

Project developed during a Frontend class

🧩 Overview
-----------

This project is a simple website built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of a class assessment.\
It includes four main pages:

-   `index.html` (home)

-   `about.html` (about)

-   `gallery.html` (gallery)

-   `contact.html` (contact)

There are also folders for styles (CSS), images (imgs), and scripts (JS), even if JavaScript usage is minimal or optional.

✅ Technologies Used
-------------------

-   HTML 5
-   CSS 3
-   JavaScript (minimal, if used)
-   Semantic markup and form validation (on the contact page)
-   Optional deployment via GitHub Pages

🎯 Project Goals
----------------

-   Apply semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
-   Validate the contact form using HTML5 or simple JavaScript
-   Demonstrate CSS knowledge for layout, color, typography, and basic responsiveness
-   Publish the project on GitHub Pages or make it available online
-   Keep commits and file structure organized

🚀 How to Run Locally
---------------------

1.  Clone this repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/DarlanSchmeller/frontend-assessment.git`

2.  Navigate into the project folder:

    `cd avaliacao_2_frontend`

3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

4.  Navigate between pages (`about.html`, `gallery.html`, `contact.html`) to explore the content.

5.  (Optional) Test the contact form --- depending on implementation, you'll see HTML validation or a simple alert.

📋 Notes
--------

-   This website was created as part of a **Frontend subject test**, focusing on **structure, semantics, and styling** rather than advanced functionality.
-   The layout was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, **without external frameworks** (like Bootstrap or Tailwind).
-   If any JavaScript is used, it's only for **basic support or validation** --- the main focus is on HTML and CSS.

✏️ Final Thoughts
-----------------

This project represents my approach to building clean, semantic, and well-structured web pages --- demonstrating core frontend principles.
